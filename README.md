# Uber Trip Analysis

## Objective
- The Objective of Project is to analyse Uber trip data using Power BI to gain insights into booking trends, revenue, and trip efficiency, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
- To understand trip patterns based on time, Uber needs to analyse ride demand and trends across different time intervals. This dashboard will help in optimizing operations, pricing, and driver availability.
- To provide in-depth insights and allow users to explore granular data, a Grid Tab will be created. This tab will enable drill-through functionality, allowing users to access detailed records based on selections made in other dashboards.
